# MCP Tool

This project scrapes job listings from a GitHub repository, matches them against a predefined profile, and generates LaTeX resumes for relevant roles.

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the main script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

Job descriptions and generated resumes are saved in the `data/` directory.
